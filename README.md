Just walked outta the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marching Powder, and man, I’ve got this mental ping-pong going on. Somehow, this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 made the chaos of Bolivia’s most infamous prison feel like a twisted carnival ride that you can't decide if you want to throw up from or ride again. My back’s aching from those stiff seats—seriously, you’d think they'd invest in some cushions—but my mind's racing faster than my taxi on a 2 a.m. empty street.

Thomas McFadden, this British guy, ends up in a flippin' Bolivian prison but decides to run tours in it. I mean, running tours in a prison! The dude’s got guts—or maybe just the kind of brain that mixes genius with insanity. Imagine inviting your coworkers to your workplace from hell as a vacation spot. Like, “Hey guys, come see my office, but 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 out for the shanks.” The irony here writes itself, doesn’t it?

> The whole thing’s such a cocktail party of madness and charm. What was more unsettling was how relaxed everyone seemed in their chaos. Like they were sipping piña coladas with a side of paranoia. Halfway through, I started wondering where this Thomas guy got his nerve. I laughed thinking, could I give tours in the back seat of my cab? “On your left, you’ll see the infamous gum under the seat that’s older than my first granddaughter.”

It dragged a bit in the middle—not gonna lie, I was almost tempted to check my phone, but there was something hypnotic about the way those inmates turned a nightmare into their own twisted little universe. Makes you wonder, is life a series of choices or just random hits of dumb luck?

Here's a bit of code because, apparently, I thought I was smarter than I am:

```python
def prison_tour(price, inmates):
    return fFor {price} bucks, you'll meet {inmates} real live lunatics!

print(prison_tour(10, 1500-ish))
```

Can’t say I didn’t think of 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   later, just to catch those bits I missed between munching on stale popcorn and shifting in my seat.

Anyway, Marching Powder’s one of those odd rides that clings to your brain long after you've left. I'm sitting here, idling at the stoplight, still chewing over it. You might wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you’re into bizarre stories that somehow feel more real than they ought to. Makes me kinda wish my fares told half as interesting stories. Or maybe not.
